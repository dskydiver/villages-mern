      "description": "After all the holiday food our bodies can use the assistance of probiotics to digest these foods(and toxins) and stay healthy.\r\nWater kefir is one of the best probiotics I've ever come across!\r\n\r\nIt's also a great vegan way to make LAB, lactobacillus, for Korean Natural Farming KNF!\r\n\r\nHere is a doc that has more info about how I grow mine, along with links to water kefir resources, as well as research articles supporting the evidence that shows kefir kills MRSA and destroys the biofilms.\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1cY_0CqOXpB-JdBFfpElITlYYIW1K2L7TJy6G-4ZrDyY/edit?usp=drivesdk\r\n\r\nDrinking water kefir has cured me of recurring staph infections as it's known to be able to break thru biofilms and help restore gut health, which is the basis of full body health.\r\n\r\nNow my kefir grains are multiplying fast and I'd like to get them out into the community.\r\n\r\n$13 for a quart of water kefir drink in a glass jar\r\nOr \r\n$13 for 1/4 cup of water kefir \"grains\" (they aren't actually a grain)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo our collective health!\r\nMay all the beneficial microbes be with you!\r\n\r\nListen\r\nToOurMotherEarth\r\n937-7335\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does it need to grow? Sugars?\r\n\r\nIts very easy! Non chlorinated water, sugar, and minerals. I also add molasses. \r\nI find they like coconut sugar the best, because they LOVE minerals! They eat all the sugar in a day tho and the drink is not sweet at all, so I add fruit and stevia, which is a natural antibiotic also shown to break biofilms!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your going to grow your own water kefir I highly recommend getting airlock lids as well so you will continue to grow the most beneficial bacteria for your health. In my research I found that some people have negative reactions to ferments grown aerobically instead of anaerobically. \r\n I sell pickle pipe airlock lids for $10 each.",

      "description": "Through breathe, visualization, eye gazing and singing I will guide you into the home of your original voice. Be released from the wandering mind and drop fully into your body and the present moment. I will guide you softly through the psychology of valuing your words and share practices to help you communicate clearly.\r\n\r\nThis is offered as a one time healing session, as repeat singing and communication lessons and as a group offering in workshop format. Decide how you would like to experience it. \r\n\r\nCultivate your courage and creativity! The home of your voice lives in your sacral chakra. In Sanskrit the sacral chakra is known as \"one's own dwelling.\" This is the residing place of your emotional body, your sensuality and your creativity. When you activate your voice you are initiating these other channels. The sacral chakra is blocked by fear, especially by the fear of death. This is why it can feel so scary to speak our truth or sing our song publicly. It requires courage, which is why we admire others when they do so!\r\n\r\nLearn how to use your voice to tune your body and eradicate fear. The law of vibrations states that you and everything else, when broken down and analyzed at it's most basic form, consists of pure energy or light which resonates and exists as a vibratory frequency or pattern. Every thought, feeling and action is effecting your personal vibration. You can release distortions of scarcity, grief, blame, shame, mediocrity, victimhood consciousness and every other pinning of fear simply by tuning your body with the vocal exercises I'll teach you.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nLowers stress levels\r\nImproves mental alertness\r\nHelps with sleep\r\nImproves your posture\r\nNatural anti-depressant\r\nStrengthens the immune system\r\nBoosts your confidence\r\nBroadens communication skills\r\nStrengthens your intuition\r\nBrings you into your body\r\nEvokes your creativity\r\nEnlivens your sensuality\r\nBuilds courage and trust\r\nWidens your social circle\r\nIgnites Play\r\n\r\nWhat to Bring:\r\nDrinking Water\r\nA personal intention to enhance your connection to your inner voice and sense of self, to find clarity for something that may be confronting or confusing you, and to empower your voice in a situation where you may have a hard time expressing yourself.\r\n\r\nWhat to Wear:\r\nComfortable, light clothing\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nPrivate residence in Pahoa\r\n\r\nLearn more at marlybenedicto.com",

Each human is unique and differentiated in its cognition as a specific frame of reference in which consciousness is seeing through.  We have been conditioned in life to see through generalized filters that serve a homogenized outcome.  it is becoming more and more obvious that we are here as beautiful individuals with a specific contribution to the world, without purpose or agenda aside from the intrinsic presence of simply being our self.  \r\n\r\nThis attunement offers a view into the practical tools to see where our masks are prevalent and  where we have judged and silenced the natural consistency of our life force, that hijacks our ability to truly allow our body the gift of being on its most natural alignment and trajectory free of resistance.  \r\n\r\nWe have entered a deep cleansing of frequency on our earthly existence and our race is mutating into new form genetically, moving from the last 400 year cycle of cooperation and contractual obligations into the empowerment of the individual spirit within each of us.  It is the time of learning to truly honor and love ourselves as we are, and as we see through our unique lens of experience so that we find a trust in our own inner authority without the need to rely on external agendas of the old story.  You are the star in your movie, the exalted life force of creation speaking through your experience.  Beyond the vanity of the story we realize that we are all in this together, and as we release the comparison models of the past we can step into the co-creative beauty of acceptance that being who we are is the best gift we have to offer.",
