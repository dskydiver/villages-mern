Everything from sharing baby items - clothing, toys, accessories -, to daycare co-ops, baby food making parties, and just support for the many questions we all have!\r\n\r\nCurrently working on my Bachelors of Education and interested in teaching and tutoring French.  I also have a background in International Relations and am very interested in local and national politics.  \r\n\r\nI have an extensive music background, and continue to perform casually at local venues.  I can play piano, trombone, drums, and a bit of guitar, and am qualified to teach piano.\r\n\r\nFinally I have a growing passion for local food production, and last year grew my first garden.  It was a huge success, mainly in the learning!  I am interested in eventually getting involved in Environmental Education, with a focus on local and wild foods.  I would love the opportunity to work and volunteer in these areas, and am continuing to expand my knowledge in them as well.",

      "description": "Checkout my G+ profile: https://plus.google.com/u/0/114867137426132367585/about\r\nI am a Bertrand Russell styled agnostic, classical liberal, that is interested in business, computer science, mycology, chemistry, botany and other sciences. I am also a critic of Intellectual property rights. I would like to see bitcoin, or something analogues or similar and better succeed. I would like to learn computer programming, but currently I am to busy and strongly dislike language and mathematics. I am probably going to change my major from chemistry to computer science when I go back to Weber State University (WSU) next semester. \r\n\r\nI admire a lot of people, or find them inspirational in one way or another.  I find Julian Assange of Wikileaks a really inspirational person. I am a fan of a lot content produced by Penn Jillette and John Stossel. I found the commencement speech by Steve Jobs also really agreeable.\r\n I find a lot of movements or organizations really fantastic. Some of them include things such as the Free State Project, Open Source Software (e-commerce software, TAILS 0.8, Tor, Forum software, WikiMedia, and of course Bitcoin) really intriguing and useful. \r\n\r\nI would like to see wireless mesh networking more prevalent in society, especially if it were long range on something such as citizen bandwidth or any other part of the electromagnetic spectrum used by amateur radio enthusiasts. This is already done and is called hinternet, apparently. \r\nI would like to also see a stronger community (developer, and user) around Freenet Classic OpenNet\r\n\r\nI a big fan of Pink Floyd, Modest Mouse, and Tom Petty. \r\n\r\nI like to garden. I grow plants such as Datura Inoxia, D. stramonium var tatula, Pereskiopsis spathulata, Echinopsis pachanoi, Argyreia Nervosa, Salvia divinorum,  Nicotiana rustica, N. sylvestris, N. tobacum, Opuntia fragilis, and a few other plants. I try to change it up each year with other exotic plants which have an interesting alkaloid profile that gives them cultural significance. I am really interested in grafting cacti to pereskiopsis, and then growing them hydroponically. \r\n\r\nI also like to grow and collect mushrooms. I have only grown a few types of mushrooms. I have recently grown Pleurotus djamor (Pink Oyster) and Lentinula edodes (Shiitake). \r\nI have tons of different cultures of different types stored in my refrigerator, however. The cultures range from wildly collected tree oyster Pleurotus ostreatus, to things like Cordyceps and other parasitic fungi. \r\n\r\nI think parasitic, or symbiotic fungi/endophytes in general are especially interesting as they have potential for medicinal use and could possibly produce complex organic molecules cost effectively in nutrient solutions. Checkout the endophyte in Taxus brevifolia that produces an anti-cancer drug. \r\n\r\nI believe I am an ENTJ or possibly a INTJ, perhaps 50% each? Not too sure I even buy into the Myer Briggs personality stuff, but it is interesting to think about, I guess? \r\n\r\nI want to have Asperger's Syndrome. I possibly have it to a small extent. \r\n\r\nI used to make nitrocellulose, black powder, fireworks/rockets, and other chemistry related things as a child (6th - 8th grade) but that become more interesting in medicinal chemistry, eventually getting an interest in liberty and entrepreneurial related endeavors.  I have always had an interest in biology. \r\n\r\nI drink a lot of green tea along with taking vitamin B complex and D3 vitamins. I take piracetam, resveratrol, silymarin, and curcumin along with a V8 fairly regularly. I also ride many miles often on my road bike. \r\n\r\nI would like for people to hurry up and cure aging. I guess if I ever get rich enough to do some serious philanthropy I will try to help cure aging.",

I also dabble in graphics design using GIMP, Blender and Inkscape.\r\n\r\nI can sing, write poems and stories.\r\n\r\nLocally, I used to drive a cab and am a responsible driver and I have a car.\r\n\r\nI once built halogen spotlight lamps, and actually found it one of the most enjoyable lines of work I've had.\r\n\r\nI recently graduated as an artisan of industry and handicrafts. I might eventually design a few spotlights just for the gist of it.

Can provide tuition to children and adults of any age in a variety of topics online around the world in English.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.indiegogo.com/montessoriobserver/x/2021145\r\n\r\nShort Summary\r\n\r\nWelcome everyone let me introduce myself. I am Darin Bicknell a Montessorian who has been teaching for over 16 years. I have recently opened my own Montessori school here in Indonesia which in June of 2013 will host students from 6 to 13 years of age, using newly created Montessori albums for the middle school and secondary school years. I am very passionate about integrating my own albums that I have developed into a digital format that can be shared with other Montessorians around the world. If we are able to achieve our goal of $5000 USD we will be able to successfully put this program up for the Montessori community. The donations will go a long way to support the development of a set of Creative Commons Montessori Albums for the Middle School and Secondary level that will be available to Montessori community at large as soon as they are ready.\r\n\r\nWhat We Need & What You Get\r\n\r\nThe cost of the project goes into mainly the design of the software for tracking the students progress but also the development of the albums and scope and sequence as the core that enables Montessorians to seemlessly track their students through the observational model employed by Montessori. \r\n\r\nAs this project will be a quick turn around we expect to have a working beta test by February 2013 and we will allow beta tester who have donated $50 to use the software by May 2013.\r\n\r\nIf we do not reach 5000 the monies will still go into the development of this project for programming costs.\r\n\r\nThe Impact\r\n\r\nThis project is unique to the Montessori community as it will allow schools a frame work to move from Elementary to Secondary. We also have plans to scale this project into the Kindergarten and Elementary for those who would like to adapt it.\r\n\r\nAs a montessorian projects like this are essential to the development of Montessori and with your help we can achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nOther Ways You Can Help\r\n\r\nIf you can't contribute with a financial donation I am always looking for people to help test and write presentations or give guidance on the scope and sequence being used. You can contact me at darin.bicknell@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nWe also accept Bitcoin bitcoin,org and Freicoin http://endlessfreico.in/ as donations.\r\n\r\nBTC 1FLoK3qKeCPUXr1nZfaftNMZHyijCJSbZq\r\nFRC 1FrTZB2zHwVc24A8bm4hgB2q1QZT3HZEDL",

There are things that people do manually in Excel every day that take hours and hours that can be done in a few minutes with formulae.\r\n\r\nI might be able to write fairly concise software for you.  I write server and desktop applications in a MS Windows environment for a living and while I wouldn't want to get into a large project for a Villages client, I could do small things if this has any value for you.\r\n\r\nI came here as part of the wave of people from Story Games.  I'm not sure what I could do for you related to games that a number of others couldn't do as well, but I might be an alternative pair of eyes or a sounding board and I do like to play new stuff.  I also make little things like https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B-nymD-keMSTMTIxMWIzOTQtMjk4NS00NjNhLTk0MjItYmMyODBjNzg5MTc0 and https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1GVrxz9lSV8qgCXkJPFshHqwe89Dpq7CMSy_UCRxPvG0/edit\r\n\r\nI spend a fair amount of time thinking about fermentation.  I'm not a particularly accomplished homebrewer, but I've made some cider, mead and soda.  I mostly make vegetable ferments along the lines of sour pickles and kimchi.  I've been toying with the idea of producing fermented vegetables commercially so I would be enthusiastic about some small-scale ferment selling experiments and I'm also open to helping you get started or troubleshoot.  (Though I do that for free as one of the moderators at http://www.wildfermentation.com/forum/)\r\n\r\nI'm a crafting/making dabbler.  I'm generally handy and can fix toilets, solder simple circuits, knit, spin, weave, throw pots, create mosaic art, etc.  I dunno if there will be call here for such skills, services or products, but it's an option.\r\n\r\nOh hey!  I'm also trained as an educator with eight years at university and two degrees.  I don't use that stuff in my daily life, but if you needed to consult on technology education, gifted education or test-theory, I could help out.  :)",

If you've seen Mouse Empires or the mostly-joking The Agent playbook for AW, that's a good barometer of my style and level of expertise.\r\n\r\nI quite enjoy combining gaming and GIS by making maps for the various games that I play in or run - if I have I have a skill worth mentioning in a gaming context, it's mapmaking.

My last client and I connected over skype and IN ONLY ONE SESSION she was able to release 12 YEARS of emotional abuse build up! She said she felt free and that the weight of the world was off her shoulders. The transformation that took place from start to finish TRULY WAS AN EMOTIONAL BREAK THROUGH MIRACLE!\r\n\r\nI absolutely love what I do as empowering the world to be their absolute best selves IS my priority. When we individually heal ourselves, we collectively heal the world. All we see is a manifestation of all that has been perpetuated by our own doing. Let us forgive each other and ourselves so we can move on with creating a most magnificent world together! :)\r\n\r\nHere's to our Awakening!\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nWith Love, \r\nSummer :)",

      "description": "Hello All, \r\nFirst, let me give thanks to villages.cc for manifesting a vision held by many of us. To be less at the whims of monetary value and more in the hands of our trusted community is a dream come true. \r\n\r\n     Right now I am focusing on creating a fun free/donation/exchange based Community Yoga/Human Mandala Play Group to meet in the park and share what we all know about the divine dance in yoga. I am also very interested diminishing the presence/revolutionizing modern health care by reintroducing people, especially those with acute and degenerative diseases, to raw foods and fresh juices followed by a change in eating habits. This allows the body to heal itself with the aid of life giving foods, thus curing themselves of often life ending ailments. Hippocrates could not have been more right when he said,¨Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food¨\r\n\r\nHow I can help you:\r\nI am always willing to help others by being available to do many tasks including: harvesting fruit trees so none goes to waste, yoga, massage (certified in neither) cook, canner, singer, organizer, sun dried yummies, can make raw juices/smoothies, giving advice, healing our bodies with food (riding it of disease), cleaner, motivator, mediator, typist, joyful, can do anything attitude, compassionate, yardwork, Hope this fits the bill!\r\n\r\nHow you can help me: \r\nmassage/bodywork, accept me as an apprentice for yoga (or help), spread the word about Community Yoga/Human Mandala Play Group, bicycle repair, distribute surplus food, collaborate in bringing nutritional awareness to those most dis-eased, exhibit compassion and/or repairing old fence.  \r\n\r\nThank you everyone for being here. Together are creating a new promising future. :)",

I always try to help where I can and be supportive of people and ideas that are important to me. \r\n\r\nSince arriving here I've participated in some interesting groups dealing with Spirituality, Philosophy, and Open Source Computing in order to research solutions to international strife.\r\n\r\nTo pay the bills I've worked as an assistant to an internationally known writer and celebrity of sorts, was a Survey Project Manager for a national consortium of construction magazines and did some municipal bonds analysis (but haven’t we all).\r\n\r\nI live very happily in Brooklyn Heights with his amazing wife Karen Tortora-Lee. I have interests in collective intelligence (and crowdsourcing), Appreciative Inquiry, scientific breakthroughs, touching stories about personal salvation through transformation, interesting art and how new web technologies (like The Shared Web and Google+) will one day save the world – one small step at a time.\r\n\r\nI hopes this inspires you to join me.",

      "description": "http://www.indiegogo.com/montessoriobservation/x/2021145\r\n\r\nShort Summary\r\n\r\nWelcome everyone let me introduce myself. I am Darin Bicknell a Montessorian who has been teaching for over 16 years. I have recently opened my own Montessori school here in Indonesia which in June of 2013 will host students from 6 to 13 years of age, using newly created Montessori albums for the middle school and secondary school years. I am very passionate about integrating my own albums that I have developed into a digital format that can be shared with other Montessorians around the world. If we are able to achieve our goal of $5000 USD we will be able to successfully put this program up for the Montessori community. The donations will go a long way to support the development of a set of Creative Commons Montessori Albums for the Middle School and Secondary level that will be available to Montessori community at large as soon as they are ready.\r\n\r\nWhat We Need & What You Get\r\n\r\nThe cost of the project goes into mainly the design of the software for tracking the students progress but also the development of the albums and scope and sequence as the core that enables Montessorians to seamlessly track their students through the observational model employed by Montessori. \r\n\r\nAs this project will be a quick turn around we expect to have a working beta test by February 2013 and we will allow beta tester who have donated $50 to use the software by May 2013. We would also of course take Village hours as donations to help fund this project and in fact we have our programmer working on this currently who connected with us right here on Villages. \r\n\r\nIf we do not reach 5000 the monies will still go into the development of this project for programming costs.\r\n\r\nThe Impact\r\n\r\nThis project is unique to the Montessori community as it will allow schools a frame work to move from Elementary to Secondary. We also have plans to scale this project into the Kindergarten and Elementary for those who would like to adapt it.\r\n\r\nAs a montessorian we all know that projects like this are essential to the development of Montessori and with your help we can achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nThe Impact\r\n\r\nThis project is unique to the Montessori community as it will allow schools a frame work to move from Elementary to Secondary.

You can contact me at darin.bicknell@gmail.com. \r\n\r\nWe also accept Bitcoin bitcoin,org and Freicoin http://endlessfreico.in/ as donations.\r\n\r\nBTC 1FLoK3qKeCPUXr1nZfaftNMZHyijCJSbZq\r\nFRC 1FrTZB2zHwVc24A8bm4hgB2q1QZT3HZEDL",

People \"bow-down\" to their chosen emperors of Earth contestants on the website (only a prototype exists today, see http://emperorcontest.com) and the bow-downs form a hierarchy, each has a total number who bow-down directly and indirectly so we can find a top seven with the biggest downlines of bow-downs to represent humans on Earth to any aliens.  It's the top seven, who are each on-duty one day per week, and their seven top slaves and their seven, or 399 positions open for a job preparing for alien contact and developing a global money system.  Maybe you are in touch with the spirit world and want to hold a contest in your local area to find a spirit world advisor to your local level of government.  When we raise money and hire Google to develop the scalable website, emperorcontest.com will hold online contests to advise every government around the globe on local spirit world matters and connect to the new Planet Earth government.",

      "description": "I am interested in designing and building cities of light that are self sustainable, and built as temple complexes in order to be harmonic with the natural cycles of the Earth.  I consider myself one of the most well versed in different complexities of sacred geometry and their relations to all levels of existence, macro to quantum. The new cities will be built upon ley lines and golden ratios with various water sources.  I am seeking like-minded individuals who have land, resources, finances to create a new template for the future of mankind in right relations to all.   I paint mandalas, build portals, bamboo temples, a musician, healer, and infinitely more skill sets. My current interest is manifesting into the physical a large dome and sphere temple which is called the Sphere of Life. it is the structure of material objects and explains how portals work.. My research clearly shows that this sphere is also an infinite energy technology used by every great ancient civilization and can be seen in monuments and glyphs all over the globe. It is the holy grail, the emperors pearl, guarded by dragons and foo dogs. I am looking to fund a documentary as well, showing how sacred geometry has been used in temples and symbolism to reign supreme over man and how to take back your power with the use of different sacred geometry patterns and materials.",

      "description": "I have 11 years professional experience as a graphic artist, with a bachelor's degree in graphic design. My main expertise and passion is in branding, which includes everything from a simple business consultation (which lends clarity in itself) to renovating or creating a company/product/service's brand identity. This may include logo, packaging, advertising, social media, etc. – everything to do with presentation, communication, and strategy.\r\n\r\nI may ask for a relatively premium value exchange for these services, but that is because I guarantee excellence, satisfaction, and functional improvement in your brand communication (ability to reach your target audience and get response) and business.  I dedicate all of the abilities and resources I have amassed through my years of experience and natural gifts in order to do this. \r\n\r\nThe clearest current example on this island is the rebranding of Big Island Booch kombucha (new logo and packaging) that happened at the beginning of 2017.",

      "description": "I am a systems administrator and mostly work with Microsoft products and have since 1999. I spent 14 years working for a large engineering firm that had to maintain ISO compliance throughout their project environment. During this time I mostly took care of the Pacific region and supported about 300 users out of around 50,000. I would build PCs and set them up on the network in our local office and field offices. I now work in the hospitality industry and have been building wireless networks and security camera systems as well as maintaining our Microsoft 2012 R2 based domain throughout our 19 sites. \r\n\r\nI'm not a programmer but I do understand a lot of what people need and can help them figure out how to make it happen. I do my best to fix my coworkers computers for free and make sure they never get taken advantage of. I am trying to build up my 2.5 acre farm and am set on becoming a hemp farmer. I don't have a ton of experience farming but my grandfather had a sheep/tree farm in Scotland and I feel like I'm trying to get back to something... In my spare time I also play around with multimedia systems, go hiking, and take lots of pictures with my camera equipment. Farming and photography would be careers I'd get into if I didn't already feel stuck in the IT field. I'm always willing to help out other photographers and help people work their land. When it comes to computers I will never say I'm the best but I will give you an honest answer and I feel that working in such a big industry has helped me get to work with some of the best minds out there.",

Since arriving on the Big Island in May, I have called South Puna my home. Experiencing the island feels like walking into a big, warm embrace - full of tears and laughter and joy all at once!\r\n\r\nFor the past 6 years, I've worked with healing professionals as a virtual business services consultant doing all sorts of things. I also really like to write and to dance.\r\n\r\nI have a deep yearning to connect with others in authentic, meaningful ways. I believe in synchronicity and the magic of sacred geometry.

Massage I've been offering since 2002, intuitive deep tissue is my style, also trained in Thai Massage. Reiki is a special healing experience I feel everyone would benefit deeply.  Meditation is something I've been training in (study as a teacher) for almost a decade and practicing since 2002 as well.  I love to combine Reiki with Coaching and meditation if you want to focus on deep transformation. My passion to coach teen girls is a revelation embracing the strength I took on at that age and being a single mother really desire to support women, mothers and single mothers. Looking forward to honoring some beautiful exchanges here.",

      "description": "The counseling process is always seeking to know the truth and to help us live a life congruent with the truth.  This requires self honesty.  Engaging in a counseling process can help anyone to suffer less and a live in a more congruent and open way.\r\n\r\nCounseling is very often about healing our ability to be in relationship. Because of past trauma and hurt, many of us wall ourselves off from connection to others. When we don't trust that it is safe to be vulnerable and authentic, and to trust and need others, we can create a defended and false self, often without realizing it. We sometimes don't even know what is in our own hearts. This can create a lot of confusion and exacerbate previous traumatic experiences as we unknowingly reiterate them. \r\n\r\nWhen we face whatever we have denied or overlooked out of fear, shame or confusion, and begin to feel safe enough to be vulnerable and authentic with another, we are able to get clarity about our life, make better choices, and experience deeper and more fulfilling connections with others and with ourselves.",

It is time that we recommune with our natural rhythms and birthright as infinite consciousness embodied in the treasure of life here to move past the old and re-weave the stories into the ceremony of life we are here to live.

Not powerful over, but powerful within. Most people think that you’re either born with power, or you’re not. Through decades of experience, we have discovered how to help your leaders connect to their inner power and strength, no matter their personality.

We all know that our thoughts affect our entire lives. Our thoughts directly affect our results. We teach 5 specific skills for leaders to become conscious of their unconscious thoughts about themselves, others, and situations, and then transform them into positive results.\r\n3.\tConnected to others.

We teach 5 specific skills for leaders to connect with anyone in a profound way.\r\n\r\nI have previously worked with Google, Facebook, hp, CAT, Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, and other organizations to transform industry engagement metrics and be named Best Place to Work – both locally and nationally – for the first time.
