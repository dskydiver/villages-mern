Never before have I experienced a bodyworker who has integrated so many different modalities in his own, intuitive,  methodical approach to heal my body: chiropractic, Rolfing, Thai, a combination of deep tissue, muscle and skeletal work  that leaves me feeling far more energized. My body feels like it has returned to my 30s.  \r\n\r\nHis fee is $1 a minute. I opt for 2 hr sessions and I always pay him more than his ask because of the value I receive from each session. \r\n\r\nAs a community, I believe we are here to support each other and David's incalculable gifts, I believe, will bring you to a new level of well-being.",
